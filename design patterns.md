- **What is design pattern ? example ?**
  as simple as (copied) : design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design;

  Design Patterns Examples for nodeJs:

  - **Singletons**: create the class only once
  - **Observables**: to create event listeners
  - **Factories**: general constructors
  - **Dependency Injection**: pass deps by reference to the class or object
  - **MiddleWares / PipeLines**: each return value of function returned to the next
  - **Streams**

- **What are middleware?**

  is a design pattern to add cross cutting concerns like without having many code contact points.

- **Object Pooling** : an Object pool is a container which contains some amount of objects. So, when an object is taken from the pool, it is not available in the pool until it is put back.

- **What is Microservice Architecture?**

  Essentially, microservice architecture is a method of developing software applications as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal.
