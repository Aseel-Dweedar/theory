- **What is design pattern ? example ?**
  
  eneral repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design, Examples:
  - **Singletons**: create the class only once. (Amazon interview)
  - **Observables**: to create event listeners
  - **Factories**: general constructors. (Atypon interview)
  - **Dependency Injection**: pass deps by reference to the class or object. (Diversity group interview)
  - **MiddleWares / PipeLines / Chain Of Responsibility**: is a design pattern to add cross-cutting concerns. the Middleware functions have access to the request object and the response object and also the next function in the application request-response lifecycle. and can validate the request. (YouApply interview)
  - **Streams**
  - **Object Pooling** : an Object pool is a container which contains some amount of objects. So, when an object is taken from the pool, it is not available in the pool until it is put back.

    [Object Pool Design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-pool-design-pattern/)

  - **Microservice Architecture** (IntraSoft interview) :a method of developing software applications as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal.
