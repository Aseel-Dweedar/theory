|                           interpriter                              |                      compiler                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------:|
|                take the statment and excute it                     |   takes the whole code and analyze it then excute it  |
|              faster in analyzeing but slower at excuting           |   slower at analyzing code and faster in excuting     |
|                             easier to debug                        |                   harder to debug                     |
|   it takes a statment by a statment and stop at any bug it finds   |  it scans the whole code then sends the error message |


- Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and hashing?

|               hashing                       |                encryption                         |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------:|
|        one way - can't be de-hashed         |          two ways - can be decrypted              |
