  authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.

- **What are JWT / Oauth2?**

  *OAuth* 2.0, which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.

  *JWT* stands for JSON Web Token, is a mechanism to verify the owner of some JSON data. It’s an encoded string, JWTs can be used to encode all relevant parts of an access token instead of having to store them in a database.
